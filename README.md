A comprehensive machine learning project to predict the severity of heart disease in patients using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. This project leverages the power of **Apache Spark (PySpark)** to build a robust, end-to-end data processing and machine learning pipeline.

The project explores and compares three different classification models to tackle this **multi-class classification problem**, with the best model achieving an accuracy of approximately **63%** on the test set.

###  Project Overview

This project's primary goal is to predict the presence and severity of heart disease, which is categorized into five levels (0: no disease, 1-4: increasing severity). It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including:
1.  Setting up a Spark environment.
2.  Performing extensive data cleaning and pre-processing.
3.  Building a modular feature engineering pipeline using `pyspark.ml`.
4.  Training and tuning multiple classification models.
5.  Evaluating and interpreting model performance.

The entire solution is built on PySpark, making it scalable to handle datasets that are too large for single-machine tools like Pandas.

###  Key Features

- **Extensive Data Pre-processing:** Includes handling missing values (imputation with median/mode), encoding categorical features, and removing statistical outliers to create a high-quality dataset.
- **PySpark ML Pipeline:** Utilizes a robust `pyspark.ml.Pipeline` to streamline feature engineering (`StringIndexer`, `VectorAssembler`) and ensure consistency between training and testing.
- **Multi-Model Comparison:** Implements, tunes, and compares three powerful classification models:
    - **Random Forest Classifier**
    - **Decision Tree Classifier**
    - **Logistic Regression** (for multi-class classification)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employs `CrossValidator` and `ParamGridBuilder` to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model, maximizing performance.
- **In-depth Model Evaluation:** Goes beyond simple accuracy to analyze model performance using:
    - **Confusion Matrices** to visualize per-class performance.
    - **Feature Importance** analysis to identify the key medical predictors of heart disease.

###  Dataset

This project uses the **Heart Disease UCI** dataset, a well-known benchmark for classification tasks in healthcare. The dataset combines data from four different hospitals and contains 14 attributes per patient. The target variable, `num`, has been used as a multi-class label representing the severity of heart disease (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

###  Workflow

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:

`Data Loading & Cleaning` -> `Feature Engineering Pipeline (Indexing & Assembling)` -> `Train/Test Split` -> `Model Training & Cross-Validation (RF, DT, LR)` -> `Prediction on Test Data` -> `Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance)`

###  Results and Analysis

The models were trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%.

#### Model Performance

The Random Forest model delivered the best performance on this multi-class classification task.

| Model                 | Test Accuracy |
| --------------------- | :-----------: |
| **Random Forest**     |   **62.9%**   |
| Logistic Regression   |     62.1%     |
| Decision Tree         |     61.4%     |

#### Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis from the best model (Random Forest) revealed the most significant predictors for heart disease severity. This provides valuable insight into which clinical factors are most influential.

| Rank | Feature         | Importance Score |
| :--: | --------------- | :--------------: |
| 1    | `cp` (Chest Pain Type) |      ~0.203      |
| 2    | `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina) |      ~0.144      |
| 3    | `oldpeak` (ST Depression) |      ~0.131      |
| 4    | `age`           |      ~0.130      |
| 5    | `thalch` (Max Heart Rate) |      ~0.088      |

###  Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of PySpark to build a multi-class classification system for predicting heart disease severity. The final Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of **62.9%**. The feature importance results align with clinical knowledge, confirming that factors like chest pain type and exercise-induced indicators are critical for diagnosis.

#### Future Work
- **Handle Class Imbalance:** The dataset is highly imbalanced. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) or using weighted loss functions could significantly improve performance on minority classes.
- **Binary Classification:** Convert the problem into a binary classification task (disease vs. no disease) by mapping `num > 0` to `1`. This simpler problem is likely to yield higher accuracy.
- **Advanced Models:** Experiment with other algorithms like Gradient-Boosted Trees (`GBTClassifier`) or XGBoost on Spark.
